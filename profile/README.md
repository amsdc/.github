All projects have been removed from this organization. This does not mean
they have been deleted.

As believers in open-source, we believe in using opensource tools to manage
our code. GitHub does not meet this requirement, hence we are shifting away
from the platform.

Some repositories which were used for team projects will be temporarily
available on my personal GitHub. Contact me privately if you want the link
to such repositories.

If you are an outsider interested in any of the other projects made by the team 
DARVIS, CBSERankList, Trunews etc.), kindly contact me through my personal
email.
